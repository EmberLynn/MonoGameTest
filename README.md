This is a simple "game" that shows a lone seagull on an island with a magically flying spider. The seagulls time on the island is counted and you can give the seagull 
a name no longer than five characters.  Backspace, enter, and A-Z keys work not including being able to capitalize.  All text is capitalized by default and input for
any other keys such as shift or numbers only print the key's actual value to the screen.  Click on the white box which is then highlighted to type in a name for the
seagull.  From there, you can press enter to name the seagull.  Click off of the box to stop typing.  Also, simple background music is played infinitely.
