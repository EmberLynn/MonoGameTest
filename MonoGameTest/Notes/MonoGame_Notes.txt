Adding Sprite Font
-right click content.mgcb -> open with MonoGame Pipeline tool
-right click content and add new item	
	-pick spritefont and name it what you will
	-edit the file and put in what font you want/have
-you can find all fonts on local machine under C:/Windows/Fonts
NOTE:
-the above only works for pre-existing fonts and not downloaded fonts
-here is what I had to do for the downloaded font:
	-in Content.mgbc in the MonoGame Pipeline Tool add the downloaded font to content
	-make sure <FontName> matches the name of the file in Content.mgcb
	-I did not add the file extension when placing inside <FontName>
