Get and Set
-allows access of private variables from outside the class

private Texture2D texture;//field
public Texture2D Texture //property
{
	get {return Texture;} //getter
	set {texture = value;} //setter
}

OR 

public Texture2D Texture { get; set; }
-field does not need to be defined
-is short-hand for the above
